To connect your Windows machine to an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu, you can use the following steps:

Get the Public IP of your EC2 Instance:

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Go to the EC2 dashboard and select your instance.
Note down the Public IPv4 address of your instance.
Use SSH Client (PuTTY):

Download and install PuTTY from the official website if you haven't already.
Convert Your Private Key (if necessary):

If your private key is in .pem format, you'll need to convert it to a .ppk file for use with PuTTY.
Open PuTTYgen (comes with PuTTY).
Click "Load" and select your .pem private key file.
Click "Save private key" to save it in .ppk format.
Configure PuTTY:

Open PuTTY and enter the Public IP of your EC2 instance into the "Host Name (or IP address)" field.
In the left pane, go to Connection -> SSH -> Auth.
Click "Browse" and select your .ppk private key file.
Go back to the Session category, enter a name for your session in "Saved Sessions," and click "Save."
Connect to Your EC2 Instance:

Click "Open" to start the SSH session.
If this is your first time connecting to the instance, you may see a security alert. Click "Yes" to continue.
You should now be logged in to your EC2 instance as the default user (usually ubuntu for Ubuntu instances).
That's it! You should now be connected to your AWS EC2 instance from your Windows machine using PuTTY.
