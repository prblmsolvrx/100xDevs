npm publish --access=public

When you run npm publish --access=public,
you are publishing a package to the npm
registry with public access. This means
that anyone can install your package using
npm install your-package-name. Public packages
are visible to everyone and can be searched
for and installed by anyone using npm. This
is in contrast to private packages, which
require authentication to access and are not
listed in the public registry.
